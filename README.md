# Valorant-Instalock
This script allows you to instalock a character in Valorant. It is currently set as jett but you can use this for other characters if you provide cropped player icons in the same folder
"# Valorant Instalock" 

To use the program load up valorant and before you search for a game make sure the file instalock.py is running. when the program is running use 't' key to toggle on and once you load in to a game it will auto select jett.

Other Characters: to use other characters make sure you screenshot and crop the character icon of the character you want both unselected and selected. move the two png images you just cropped into the same folder and then edit the instalock.py file and change the name of jett.png and selectedjett.png to the new images respectively.

Risks: Valorant does use anticheat software so there is a chance that this might be detected as a form of cheating so use at your own risk please!
